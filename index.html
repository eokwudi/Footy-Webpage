        <p> From the money, to the cars, to the clothes it can seem that fame
          comes naturally to Cristiano Ronaldo. He has spent years as the most popular
          footballer on the planet and has in turn garnered the admiration and disdain of
          many. Behind that chiseled exterior though is a simple boy from Madeira who spent his
          youth training relentlessly, even when no food was available. His hard work and determination
          has cemented his place in football history as one of the greatest and CR7 does not seem to be slowing
          any time soon </p>

          <p> When Liverpool signed Virgil Van Dijk from
            Southampton during the 2017/2018 season, no
            defender had ever had more pressure to be an immediate success
            but Van Dijk met and exceeded the pressure with aplomb. From winning the
            PFA's Player of the Year award to leading Liverpool to a Champions League
            title, Van Dijk has brought the defender position back to the forefront.</p>
